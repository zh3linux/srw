                                <h2 id="sources-of-monitoring-data">Sources of Monitoring Data</h2>
<p>Your choice of monitoring system(s) will be informed by the specific sources of mon&#x2010; itoring data you&#x2019;ll use. This section discusses two common sources of monitoring data: logs and metrics. There are other valuable monitoring sources that we won&#x2019;t cover here, like distributed tracing and runtime introspection.</p>
<p>Metrics are numerical measurements representing attributes and events, typically harvested via many data points at regular time intervals. Logs are an append-only record of events. This chapter&#x2019;s discussion focuses on structured logs that enable rich query and aggregation tools as opposed to plain-text logs.</p>
<p>Google&#x2019;s logs-based systems process large volumes of highly granular data. There&#x2019;s some inherent delay between when an event occurs and when it is visible in logs. For analysis that&#x2019;s not time-sensitive, these logs can be processed with a batch system, interrogated with ad hoc queries, and visualized with dashboards. An example of this workflow would be using Cloud Dataflow to process logs, BigQuery for ad hoc quer&#x2010; ies, and Data Studio for the dashboards.</p>
<p>By contrast, our metrics-based monitoring system, which collects a large number of metrics from every service at Google, provides much less granular information, but in near real time. These characteristics are fairly typical of other logs- and metrics- based monitoring systems, although there are exceptions, such as real-time logs sys&#x2010; tems or high-cardinality metrics.</p>
<p>Our alerts and dashboards typically use metrics. The real-time nature of our metrics- based monitoring system means that engineers can be notified of problems very rap&#x2010; idly. We tend to use logs to find the root cause of an issue, as the information we need is often not available as a metric.</p>
<p>When reporting isn&#x2019;t time-sensitive, we often generate detailed reports using logs processing systems because logs will nearly always produce more accurate data than metrics.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re alerting based on metrics, it might be tempting to add more alerting based on logs&#x2014;for example, if you need to be notified when even a single exceptional event happens. We still recommend metrics-based alerting in such cases: you can incre&#x2010; ment a counter metric when a particular event happens, and configure an alert based on that metric&#x2019;s value. This strategy keeps all alert configuration in one place, making it easier to manage (see &#x201C;Managing Your Monitoring System&#x201D; on page 67).</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>The following real-world examples illustrate how to reason through the process of choosing between monitoring systems.</p>
<h4 id="move-information-from-logs-to-metrics">Move information from logs to metrics</h4>
<p><strong>Problem.</strong> The HTTP status code is an important signal to App Engine customers debugging their errors. This information was available in logs, but not in metrics. The metrics dashboard could provide only a global rate of all errors, and did not include any information about the exact error code or the cause of the error. As a result, the workflow to debug an issue involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Looking at the global error graph to find a time when an error occurred.</li>
<li>Reading log files to look for lines containing an error.</li>
<li>Attempting to correlate errors in the log file to the graph.</li>
</ol>
<p>The logging tools did not give a sense of scale, making it hard to know if an error seen in one log line was occurring frequently. The logs also contained many other irrelevant lines, making it hard to track down the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed solution.</strong> The App Engine dev team chose to export the HTTP status code as a label on the metric (e.g., requests_total{status=404} versus requests_total {status=500}). Because the number of different HTTP status codes is relatively limi&#x2010; ted, this did not increase the volume of metric data to an impractical size, but did make the most pertinent data available for graphing and alerting.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome.</strong> This new label meant the team could upgrade the graphs to show separate lines for different error categories and types. Customers could now quickly form con&#x2010; jectures about possible problems based on the exposed error codes. We could now also set different alerting thresholds for client and server errors, making the alerts trigger more accurately.</p>
<h4 id="improve-both-logs-and-metrics">Improve both logs and metrics</h4>
<p><strong>Problem.</strong> One Ads SRE team maintained ~50 services, which were written in a num&#x2010; ber of different languages and frameworks. The team used logs as the canonical source of truth for SLO compliance. To calculate the error budget, each service used a logs processing script with many service-specific special cases. Here&#x2019;s an example script to process a log entry for a single service:</p>
<pre><code>  If the HTTP status code was in the range (500, 599)
    AND the &apos;SERVER ERROR&apos; field of the log is populated
    AND DEBUG cookie was not set as part of the request
    AND the url did not contain &apos;/reports&apos;
    AND the &apos;exception&apos; field did not contain &apos;com.google.ads.PasswordException&apos;
    THEN increment the error counter by 1
</code></pre><p>These scripts were hard to maintain and also used data that wasn&#x2019;t available to the metrics-based monitoring system. Because metrics drove alerts, sometimes the alerts would not correspond to user-facing errors. Every alert required an explicit triage step to determine if it was user-facing, which slowed down response time.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed solution.</strong> The team created a library that hooked into the logic of the frame&#x2010; work languages of each application. The library decided if the error was impacting users at request time. The instrumentation wrote this decision in logs and exported it as a metric at the same time, improving consistency. If the metric showed that the service had returned an error, the logs contained the exact error, along with request- related data to help reproduce and debug the issue. Correspondingly, any SLO- impacting error that manifested in the logs also changed the SLI metrics, which the team could then alert on.</p>
<p>Outcome. By introducing a uniform control surface across multiple services, the team reused tooling and alerting logic instead of implementing multiple custom solutions. All services benefited from removing the complicated, service-specific logs processing code, which resulted in increased scalability. Once alerts were directly tied to SLOs, they were more clearly actionable, so the false-positive rate decreased significantly.</p>
<h4 id="keep-logs-as-the-data-source">Keep logs as the data source</h4>
<p><strong>Problem.</strong> While investigating production issues, one SRE team would often look at the affected entity IDs to determine user impact and root cause. As with the earlier App Engine example, this investigation required data that was available only in logs. The team had to perform one-off log queries for this while they were responding to incidents. This step added time to incident recovery: a few minutes to correctly put together the query, plus the time to query the logs.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed solution.</strong> The team initially debated whether a metric should replace their log tools. Unlike in the App Engine example, the entity ID could take on millions of different values, so it would not be practical as a metric label.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the team decided to write a script to perform the one-off log queries they needed, and documented which script to run in the alert emails. They could then copy the command directly into a terminal if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome.</strong> The team no longer had the cognitive load of managing the correct one-off log query. Accordingly, they could get the results they needed faster (although not as quickly as a metrics-based approach). They also had a backup plan: they could run the script automatically as soon as an alert triggered, and use a small server to query the logs at regular intervals to constantly retrieve semifresh data.</p>
