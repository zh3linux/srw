                                <h2 id="metrics-with-purpose">Metrics with Purpose</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 covers how to monitor and alert using SLI metrics when a system&#x2019;s error budget is under threat. SLI metrics are the first metrics you want to check when SLO- based alerts trigger. These metrics should appear prominently in your service&#x2019;s dash&#x2010; board, ideally on its landing page.</p>
<p>When investigating the cause of an SLO violation, you will most likely not get enough information from the SLO dashboards. These dashboards show that you are violating the SLO, but not necessarily why. What other data should the monitoring dashboards display?</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve found the following guidelines helpful in implementing metrics. These metrics should provide reasonable monitoring that allows you to investigate production issues and also provide a broad range of information about your service.</p>
<h3 id="intended-changes">Intended Changes</h3>
<p>When diagnosing an SLO-based alert, you need to be able to move from alerting met&#x2010; rics that notify you of user-impacting issues to metrics that tell you what is causing these issues. Recent intended changes to your service might be at fault. Add monitor&#x2010; ing that informs you of any changes in production.4 To determine the trigger, we rec&#x2010; ommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the version of the binary.</li>
<li>Monitor the command-line flags, especially when you use these flags to enable and disable features of the service.</li>
<li>If configuration data is pushed to your service dynamically, monitor the version of this dynamic configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these pieces of the system aren&#x2019;t versioned, you should be able to monitor the timestamp at which it was last built or packaged.</p>
<p>When you&#x2019;re trying to correlate an outage with a rollout, it&#x2019;s much easier to look at a graph/dashboard linked from your alert than to trawl through your CI/CD (continu&#x2010; ous integration/continuous delivery) system logs after the fact.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>Even if your service didn&#x2019;t change, any of its dependencies might change or have problems, so you should also monitor responses coming from direct dependencies.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s reasonable to export the request and response size in bytes, latency, and response codes for each dependency. When choosing the metrics to graph, keep the four golden signals in mind. You can use additional labels on the metrics to break them down by response code, RPC (remote procedure call) method name, and peer job name.</p>
<p>Ideally, you can instrument the lower-level RPC client library to export these metrics once, instead of asking each RPC client library to export them.5 Instrumenting the client library provides more consistency and allows you to monitor new dependen&#x2010; cies for free.</p>
<p>You will sometimes come across dependencies that offer a very narrow API, where all functionality is available via a single RPC called Get, Query, or something equally unhelpful, and the actual command is specified as arguments to this RPC. A single instrumentation point in the client library falls short with this type of dependency: you will observe a high variance in latency and some percentage of errors that may or may not indicate that some part of this opaque API is failing entirely. If this depend&#x2010; ency is critical, you have a couple of options to monitor it well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export separate metrics to tailor for the dependency, so that the metrics can unpack requests they receive to get at the actual signal.</li>
<li>Ask the dependency owners to perform a rewrite to export a broader API that supports separate functionality split across separate RPC services and methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="saturation">Saturation</h3>
<p>Aim to monitor and track the usage of every resource the service relies upon. Some resources have hard limits you cannot exceed, like RAM, disk, or CPU quota alloca&#x2010; ted to your application. Other resources&#x2014;like open file descriptors, active threads in any thread pools, waiting times in queues, or the volume of written logs&#x2014;may not have a clear hard limit but still require management.</p>
<p>Depending on the programming language in use, you should monitor additional resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Java: The heap and metaspace size, and more specific metrics depending on what type of garbage collection you&#x2019;re using</li>
<li>In Go: The number of goroutines</li>
</ul>
<p>The languages themselves provide varying support to track these resources.</p>
<p>In addition to alerting on significant events as described in Chapter 5 you might also need to set up alerting that fires when you approach exhaustion for specific resources, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the resource has a hard limit</li>
<li>When crossing a usage threshold causes performance degradation</li>
</ul>
<p>You should have monitoring metrics to track all resources&#x2014;even resources that the service manages well. These metrics are vital in capacity and resource planning.</p>
<h3 id="status-of-served-traffic">Status of Served Traffic</h3>
<p>It&#x2019;s a good idea to add metrics or metric labels that allow the dashboards to break down served traffic by status code (unless the metrics your service uses for SLI pur&#x2010; poses already include this information). Here are some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>For HTTP traffic, monitor all response codes, even if they don&#x2019;t provide enough signal for alerting, because some can be triggered by incorrect client behavior.</li>
<li>If you apply rate limits or quota limits to your users, monitor aggregates of how many requests were denied due to lack of quota.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphs of this data can help you identify when the volume of errors changes noticea&#x2010; bly during a production change.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-purposeful-metrics">Implementing Purposeful Metrics</h3>
<p>Each exposed metric should serve a purpose. Resist the temptation of exporting a handful of metrics just because they are easy to generate. Instead, think about how these metrics will be used. Metric design, or lack thereof, has implications.</p>
<p>Ideally, metric values used for alerting change dramatically only when the system enters a problem state, and don&#x2019;t change when a system is operating normally. On the other hand, metrics for debugging don&#x2019;t have these requirements&#x2014;they&#x2019;re intended to provide insight about what is happening when alerts are triggered. Good debugging metrics will point at some aspect of the system that&#x2019;s potentially causing the issues. When you write a postmortem, think about which additional metrics would have allowed you to diagnose the issue faster.</p>
