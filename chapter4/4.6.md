## Conclusion

Because the SRE role is responsible for the reliability of systems in production, SREs are often required to be intimately familiar with a service’s monitoring system and its features. Without this knowledge, SREs might not know where to look, how to iden‐ tify abnormal behavior, or how to find the information they need during an emergency.

We hope that by pointing out monitoring system features we find useful and why, we can help you evaluate how well your monitoring strategy fits your needs, explore some additional features you might be able to leverage, and consider changes you might want to make. You’ll probably find it useful to combine some source of metrics and logging in your monitoring strategy; the exact mix you need is highly context- dependent. Make sure to collect metrics that serve a particular purpose. That purpose may be to enable better capacity planning, assist in debugging, or directly notify you about problems.

Once you have monitoring in place, it needs to be visible and useful. To this end, we also recommend testing your monitoring setup. A good monitoring system pays divi‐ dends. It is well worth the investment to put substantial thought into what solutions best meet your needs, and to iterate until you get it right.
